		<h4>ABOUT US</h4>
		MusicHub is New York's largest direct online retailer for musical
		instruments and pro audio equipment. We also offer a wide range of
		services to the music entertainment industry. The MusicHub brand is
		well known for our focus on customer service and it has become one of
		the most trusted names in the industry. MusicHub maintains very
		healthy tie-ups with top performing individual artists, bands
		and music producers and we vow to deliver the same service to all
		musicians in the US. Our vision is to dominate all aspects of the music
		industry including music creation, production, education, consumption,
		artist relations, curation and culture. MusicHub has worked with many
		reputable brands including Walt Disney Studio, Sony Music, Harman Professional and Gibson. In
		2012, Music Trades Magazine, USA, ranked MusicHub among the
		world's top 20 music retailers. Our Entertainment division
		conceptualised and executed a full-scale two-day heavy
		metal festival ‘BIG69’ in in Texas (January 2015), bringing down several
		international and US bands to play across three stages. MusicHub has grown over 350% in 2015-16.
		We look forward to continuing our accelerated growth and fulfilling
		our vision for the company.
